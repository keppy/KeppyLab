## About the Lab
KeppyLab is my passion project. For many years I have dreamed of running an AI lab that focuses on three core values:

1. Open source everything you can
1. Cross-domain pollination
1. Evidence over assumptions

We are in the early stages of forming the tool chain and what our core focuses will be, but there are many areas [ripe for investigation](https://github.com/keppy/KeppyLab/blob/ripe-problems/ripe_problems.md).

If you are in the Seattle area check out our monthly event, the [KeppyLab AI Collective](https://www.eventbrite.com).

## Current Projects and Happenings
I'm currently working on [WorldEnder.ai](https://www.github.com/keppy/WorldEnder.ai); an interactive RAG system about the apocalypse. Through this project we will learn just how far we can push RAG in a fun (read: slightly concerning) direction :octicons-thumbsup-24:

I write about fine tuning and pushing the boundaries of generative AI. Drop me a line ^^james@keppylab.com^^!
